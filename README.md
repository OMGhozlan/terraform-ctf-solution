# Terraform CTF Challenge - Solution Template

🎯 **Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges implemented in Terraform!**

This repository contains a complete solution template for the Terraform CTF Challenge provider. Learn Terraform by solving progressively difficult challenges and capturing flags!

## 🏴 How It Works (CTF Paradigm)

Unlike traditional tutorials, this follows the **Capture The Flag** paradigm:

1. **Read the challenge description** - Understand what you need to accomplish
2. **Build your solution** - Write Terraform code to meet requirements
3. **Submit proof of work** - Validate your solution
4. **Capture the flag** - If successful, the flag is revealed as your reward!

**Important:** Flags are **OUTPUTS** (rewards), not **INPUTS** (requirements). You don't need to know the flag beforehand!
